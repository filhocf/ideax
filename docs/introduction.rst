What is innovation?

According Geoffrey Nicholson, the PostIt's father from 3M, “Research is the transformation of money into knowledge. Innovation is the transformation of knowledge into money.”

Innovation is when an idea meets the needs and expectations of the market, is feasible from an economic and sustainable point of view and offers financial returns to companies. **That is, every innovation must generate results**.

Innovation is neither invention nor discovery. She may require these concepts, and often this happens. But its focus is not knowledge, but economic performance. The first application of an innovation should be strategy, approaching to the maximum of its ideal. But for an invention to be considered an innovation, your customers need to recognize the value of your entire investment.
